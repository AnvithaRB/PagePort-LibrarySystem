# PagePort - Community Library Management System

PagePort is a web-based Community Library Management System developed as part of our Software Engineering course project. It provides users with an interface to view available books and simulate actions such as borrowing or reserving books. This front-end application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Objectives

- Create a simple and intuitive user interface for a library catalog
- Simulate book borrowing and reservation features
- Display the status of each book (available, borrowed, reserved)
- Disable borrow and reserve buttons when the book is already borrowed

## Team Member Responsibilities

- Anvitha Reddy Baddam: Designed the user interface and book catalog page
- [Team Member 2 Name]: Implemented JavaScript logic for button interaction and book status
- [Team Member 3 Name]: Worked on layout design, integration, and documentation

## Objective Completion

- The project successfully delivers a functioning front-end interface
- Book status updates dynamically based on user interaction
- All key interface features have been completed

## Requirements Collection

Requirements were collected through:
- Brainstorming sessions among team members
- Studying user needs in a community library context
- Referring to existing systems and prioritizing usability

## Design and Architecture

The application follows a modular front-end structure:
- HTML for page structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for dynamic behavior (e.g., disabling buttons based on status)
